## Project Description/Goal

Hello. My name is Jota and in this project, we're going to approach one of the main problems of our time. The mask. As we all know, not everyone has the same concept of security against the COVID-19 or popularly called CORONAVIRUS. 


We will try to create an algorithm to detect if a person, is wearing mask or not. This algorithm could be used like an alarm for security cameras in a shop or establishment to warn people to wear a mask or it will be useful to facial security checks at train stations if it is mandatory.
